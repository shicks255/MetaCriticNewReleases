Metacritic New Music Release Email Script

To use, enter necessary information in the config.py file
The port and emailLibrary properties are currently configured for yahoo mail.

When the script runs, the newReleases.txt will be populated
with toString-like versions of each release.
The log file keeps track of what's happening.

I use it on windows with a daily task in the morning.

The email is a simple table.
